    question: "What happens if the striker is also pocketed while covering the queen?",
    answer:
      "The cover is not valid. The queen is returned to the center, and the coin used to cover (if pocketed) is also returned. Additionally, a penalty applies: one of your already pocketed coins must be returned to the board."
  },
  {
    question: "What is double striking in Carrom?",
    answer:
      "Double striking means the striker is hit more than once in the same shot, either by dragging, pushing, or accidentally tapping twice. This is a foul and results in a penalty."
  },
  {
    question: "What if a player pockets their last coin before touching the queen?",
    answer:
      "The finish is invalid. The last coin is returned to the board, the queen (if pocketed) is also returned, and the player loses their turn."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a player adjust their coin by hitting it without pocketing?",
    answer:
      "Yes, players may legally reposition their coin with a clean strike as long as the striker is played legally. However, if the striker is pocketed during this adjustment, it is a foul."
  },
  {
    question: "What about hitting the opponent’s coin to block their chance?",
    answer:
      "It is allowed to disturb or reposition the opponent’s coin with a legal strike. But if the opponent’s coin is pocketed, it is a foul: that coin is returned to the board, and the striker’s player also returns one of their pocketed coins as penalty."
  },
  {
    question: "Can players customize the rules?",
    answer:
      "Yes. While tournaments follow ICF rules, family or casual games often use custom house rules. Players should agree on these rules before starting, such as queen being optional, no penalties for fouls, or alternative scoring methods."
  },
  {
    question: "How many points does a Carrom game have?",
    answer:
      "Officially, matches are played to 25 points or 8 boards. A winner scores points equal to the opponent’s remaining coins, plus 3 points if the queen is covered. The maximum per board is 10 points."
  },
  {
    question: "What if a coin touches the striker again while returning?",
    answer:
      "If a coin rebounds and touches the striker again in the same shot, it is considered a double strike (foul). Penalty: one of the player’s pocketed coins is returned to the board, along with any coin pocketed in that foul."
